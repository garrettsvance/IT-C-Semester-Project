# IT-C101-Website

**About your project - test**

For your semester project you (with your partner) will be putting together a website. It must
meet all of the minimum requirements listed below to receive full credit. The entire project is worth
100 points. Five points will be deducted for each of the Minimum Requirements not completed.
Additional points will be deducted for not following the layout, coloring, styling and usability guidelines
covered in class. Because this is a beginning class, you will not be graded on the total look, feel,
operability, and quality of the website; you will be graded on whether you implemented each of the
requirements.

**A couple of guidelines for your project:**

1. Beware of over-ambition: It is easy to think of lots of functionality you would want to add to
your website, but it may not be feasible (or appropriate) to do it all in the time you have
available for this class.
2. Do not stress too much over this: Make this a fun learning experience for you and your project
partner!
Content
You may choose the content of your website to be either:
1. A website of professional information. Look ahead to when you graduate and will be looking for
a job; begin to compile information about yourself that would be useful.
2. A website of personal information, about yourself, your sibling(s), your parents, grandparents,
or any relative you’d like to learn more about.
3. A website that performs a function of your choice, to serve a purpose you find useful. We
encourage you to think about needs you have or are aware of, and how a website might help
meet those needs.
